#### Fix & Write Code  
* [Fix the Code #1](fix_code_1.py) 🥉
  * Fix the code so it prints a greeting. 
    * Expected output: `Welcome to CompSci!`
    * GitHub will test your solution when you submit. See instructions at the end of this page.
* [Write Code #1](write_code_1.py) 🥈
  * Tell the computer to print your own greeting/message.
* [Fix the Code #2](fix_code_2.py) 🥉
  * This program should assign the string "geometry" to the variable `math_class` and print a response. 
    * Your print statement should use a formatted string (f-string) to insert the value of the variable into the sentence.
      * Expected output: `My favorite class is geometry!`
    * GitHub will run a test on this when you submit it.
