# Lesson 2.1 Practice (Strings 1)

Use this repo to complete your practice for Lesson 2.1.

## Complete the following:
#### Edpuzzle
* [Edpuzzle practice](edpuzzle_practice.py) ðŸ¥‰
  * Use this for practice during the Edpuzzle video. You can use the main window or the Python Console (see button at the bottom of the PyCharm window)

#### ReadingBat
Complete each exercise linked below. **Be sure you are logged into ReadingBat!**

**len()**
* [len1](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/String%20Operations/strlen1) ðŸ¥‰

**Slicing**
* [slice2](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/String%20Operations/slice2) ðŸ¥‰
* [slice4](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/String%20Operations/slice4) ðŸ¥ˆ
* [slice5](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/String%20Operations/slice5) ðŸ¥‰

**Concatenation**
* [concat1](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/String%20Operations/concat1) ðŸ¥‰
* [concat2](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/String%20Operations/concat2) ðŸ¥ˆ

#### Fix & Write Code  
* [Fix the Code #1](fix_code_1.py) ðŸ¥‰
  * A quote from Boris Beizer is provided three times. Format each to display nicely on the screen, using different formatting techniques. 
    * You should not have to scroll sideways to see the output!
  * Be sure to use a multi-line quote, \n and \t escape characters, and any other formatting you wish.  
  * Be sure to run your program to be sure it works correctly. (There is no test code for this.)
* [Write Code #1](write_code_1.py) ðŸ¥ˆ
  * Write a (very) short play (4-6 lines). As with any script, each character's dialogue should be displayed on their own line. 
  * Here's the catch: you can only use 1 print statement!! ðŸ˜²
  * Use `\n` and `\t` at least once in your program. You may also use multi-line strings or any other formatting you wish.
* [Fix the Code #2](fix_code_2.py) ðŸ¥‰
  * This program should:
    * prompt the user for two different strings
    * concatenate them
    * print the result and the length of the new string
  
  Example:
  ```buildoutcfg
  Enter a word: (buffalo)
  Enter another word: (tiger)
  The string buffalotiger has 12 letters.
  ```
  * **Note:** there is a GitHub test for this. Be sure the output format matches the example.
      
* [Write Code #2](write_code_2.py) ðŸ¥ˆ
  * Prompt the user for three strings
  * Concatenate them together with spaces between them
  * Print the result
  
  Example:
    ```buildoutcfg
    Enter a word: (apple)
    Enter a second word: (purple)
    Enter a third word: (kite)
    output: apple purple kite
    ```
* [Fix the Code #3](fix_code_3.py) ðŸ¥‰
  * This program should:
    * Assign `Athenian Wilderness Experience` to `junior_year`.
    * Use string slicing to get `Wilderness` and print it.
    * Calculate the length of `Wilderness`
    * Print the length
  * This is tested by GitHub. Pay attention to the formatting of the output.
  Example:
    ```buildoutcfg
    first output: Wilderness
    second output: Length: 10
    ```
  
* [Write Code #3](write_code_3.py) ðŸ¥‰
  * Assign `supercalifragilisticexpialidocious` to a variable.
  * Use string slicing to print the string `agilisitic`
  * This is tested by GitHub. Pay attention to the output.
